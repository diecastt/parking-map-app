# Montreal Parking App 
#https://diecastt.github.io/parking-map-app/
#### The purpose of this project is to practice React.js, API fetching, and build deployment.

#### This website uses the City of Montreal open database, more specifically the parking signage API, found at https://donnees.montreal.ca/ville-de-montreal/stationnement-sur-rue-signalisation-courant. This API has provides the geolocation of all street parking signs in the City of Montreal.

#### The Google Maps API was also used in order to render the in-site interactive map.
### Familiarized myself with: 
> - React.js Hooks (State/Effect)
> - Asynchronous API (async/await)
> - JSX, components, props, Material UI, etc.
> - Node.js and Express.js

## Used
(React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Material UI, Express.js, deployed with GitHub Pages)

### `! Important Notice !`
Due to the limitations of the City of Montreal Open database API, the number of sign locations is limited and not all locations are currently displayed.
